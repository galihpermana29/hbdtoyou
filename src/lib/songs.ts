I carved my name into your ribcage
We talked of lands away from this cage
You said, don’t fret love, someday I’ll be my own man, I'll be free
Oh, but darling did you mean
Darling, did you mean free from me?
 
You promised home
The kind I'd never known, oh
But here we are, skin and flesh and beating hearts
and I'm wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong
You said, “Let's make ourselves our very own brigade, this love our shield, our blade”
Oh, but darling do you see the cuts from which I bleed?
It’s me you’ve slain
 
I didn’t obliterate these walls for you to come and raid my home
And here you are right next to me
Ironically, I've never felt more alone
 
I fell for you faster than I fell apart
And I guess I'm the one to blame for letting myself fall too hard
I ripped my heart out and put it in your hands in hopes that we’d put up a fight
How paradoxical, since now all I can think about is when will we stop trying
Ooh
 
Oooh, how do we stay afloat
When do I let go?
 
All you do is blindside me, it's hard to be brave
But when the night cuts into the day, it’s your love I crave
I must’ve thanked my lucky stars too much,
they left me sitting in too much dust
 
You know all my dreams
You were one, so it seemed
And I love you but with you
It's heartache I breathe
You gave it your all, just with everything you took from me
 
Oh, my love
Is this the end for us?
Maybe we’ve had enoughI carved my name into your ribcage

      "Oh, why can't we for once Say what we want, say what we feel?",
    lyrics: `
His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
The kind that colors the sky
Heart intangible, slips away faster than
Dandelion fluff in the sunlight
And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
Uncoverin' the dreams, he dreams at night
As much and hard as he tries to hide
I can see right through, see right through
His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
What I would give for me to get my feet
Back on the ground, head off the clouds
I laugh at how we're polar opposites
I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
Just to make him smile, make him smile
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
Electricity surgin' in the air
He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
That I'm hopelessly captivated
By a boy who thinks love's overrated
How did I get myself in this arrangement?
It baffles me, too, baffles me, too
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take
I'll be your safety net, so why not raise the stakes?
And I can hear your heart from across the room
Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
Lie to me all you please, I can see right through
See right through
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
Ooh-ah, oh-oh, oh

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear, and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And It's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Never knew I could feel that much

Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me
Kiss me, down by the broken tree house
Swing me, upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
Oh, kiss me, beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far

'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time

I'm still into you

Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes

Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you

she loves the sand, she loves the bar
got half the beach left in my car
sweetheart from a sweet home alabama trailer park
straight off the page of a magazine
a quintessential beauty queen
my princess di in vintage tees and torn up jeans

everybody thinks i’m lying
when i say she’s mine ‘cause

she’s out of my league in every single way
and can you believe she’s sleeping at my place
it’s just a matter of time but i hope she never realizes
she’s so much better than me
she’s out of my league
she’s out of my league

i told my mom that i’m in love
i sent a pic, dad’s got a crush
best friends are pumped, throwing high fives, wishing me luck
sometimes i think that if she left
how could i ever love again
i must be doing something right ‘cause she hasn’t left, yet

she’s out of my league in every single way
and can you believe she’s sleeping at my place
it’s just a matter of time but i hope she never realizes
she’s so much better than me
she’s out of my league

and i don’t mind it, my silver lining
she colors life in, my princess di, yea
i think i’m flying, my silver lining
she colors life in, my princess di

she’s out of my league in every single way
and i can’t believe she’s sleeping at my place
it’s just a matter of time but i hope she never realizes
