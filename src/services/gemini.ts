    Generate a Netflix-style graduation story for a student with the following details:
    - Name: ${input.name}
    - University: ${input.university}
    - Graduation Date: ${input.graduationDate}
    - Movie Genre for their bachelor journey: ${input.movieGenre}

    From only these details, you must invent a central conflict and a narrative arc that perfectly fits the specified movie genre. The tone, plot points, and episode titles must be heavily influenced by the ${input.movieGenre}.

    Create a graduation journey narrative with the following components:

    - A catchy subtitle: A genre-appropriate tagline for the series.
    - A logline: A powerful, one-sentence hook that captures the essence of a university journey as if it were a ${input.movieGenre} film.
    - A compelling synopsis: A descriptive paragraph (3-5 sentences) that sets the scene at ${input.university}. It should introduce ${input.name} as the protagonist and establish the high stakes and a central, genre-specific conflict leading up to their ${input.graduationDate}.
    - Four episodes that follow a clear narrative arc:
      - Episode 1 (The Setup): Introduce the protagonist's initial hopes and the first signs of the genre-specific conflict.
      - Episode 2 (The Rising Stakes): Depict the main struggle escalating, pushing the protagonist to their limits.
      - Episode 3 (The Climax): Showcase the peak of their academic or personal struggleâ€”the final, make-or-break moment of their degree.
      - Episode 4 (The Finale): Show the resolution of the conflict, the graduation itself, and a final scene that reflects the journey's genre.
